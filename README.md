Cloud Agnostic Rotating Proxy Commander, or CARP Commander, utilizes packer and terraform to generate images that can be deployed to any cloud provider. Currently, while still being produced the tool is designed to work on Digital Ocean. However, as time goes on more providers will be added.

### Set up guide
To set up the tool, create a symbolic link between the executable and /usr/bin/proxy-manager so that if you pull an update it automatically updates the service.
After that, you can review any helpful commands with `proxy-manager -h` or refer to this guide.
