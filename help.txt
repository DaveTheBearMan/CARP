Arguments:
	deploy 
		- No arguments, runs the terraform configuration with the snapshot id, and outputs to ansible inventory
	rebuild 
		- proxy <#/all>
			- Rebuilds a specified node, or, all nodes.
		- all
			- Rebuilds the manager and then every single node.
	image
		- Runs connectNodes ansible to connect all nodes to the current manager instance
		- Only works with a running manager, otherwise, the nodes will be lost.
		- This is used primarily for testing, or if you want access to the nodes from the TUI 
	redirect
		- clean
		- <IP_ADDRESS> <PORT,PORT,...> [SSL] 
			- Runs socat to redirect every nodes incoming traffic on the specified ports to the ports on the given IP. 
			- Optionally has argument for SSL (left blank if not needed), that uses SSL provider in Socat
	build
		- in-place <LOOP: T/F>
			- Gradually rebuilds nodes and reimages them to connect to manager
			- If loop is enabled, it will simply continue to do so.
		- Rebuilds proxy manager service and connects you to the TUI
			- Same as running: proxy_manager -v -C, -v -b, -v -p node, -v -p manager, -v deploy, connect
	ls
		- ansible
			- Outputs ansible inventory
		- default
			- Outputs terraform inventory
